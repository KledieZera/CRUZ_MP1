				<h3>These are the schools that I studied in!</h3>

						I studied 14 years in this school. Kindergarten, grade school, junior high school, and senior high school. It was a good school. I never wanted to leave it because of it's proximity to my home, and it can actually be also considered as my 2nd home at the time.

						I'm still studying here as an IT student. To be honest, I have a love-hate relationship with it because of how hard it is to study here. Nonetheless, I would still like to push through with studying until I graduate.

				<h3>Things I've worked on!</h3>

						Most of the projects (that I'm proud of) are videos. I have proficiency in narration, in video-editing, using instruments, and (not to toot my own horn) singing as well.

				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p>The name Cheldie came from the combined nicknames of my parents, which is Cheng and Eldie. I'm currently 21 years old when I made this website. I know how to play instruments, but I'm not too skillful as the famous ones. I could say that I kinda am sporty, but I'm an average player, much like how I am at most things. Nonetheless, I still am aiming to be better at stuff and is willing to participate in different activities to learn something new for myself.</p>
				<p>When it comes to leadership skills, some of the people I worked with have told me that I can give out tasks equally (including to myself) while giving enough motivation (or reason) for them to take it. I can drive people towards a goal that's agreed upon by most, and would be willing to adjust whenever there are disagreements about the tasks.</p>
				<p>Others have also told me that I am a somewhat skilled in social interactions. I think it's because I can talk to most people without feeling uncomfortable, and also because I pick my topics wisely based on the person that I talk to. Some may not agree with this, given that I don't really know what they think, but some people seem to agree with the fact that they feel comfortable in talking to me on either random or specific topics which they care about.</p>
